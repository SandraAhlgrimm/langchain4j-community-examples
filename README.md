# [LangChain4j](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j) Community Examples

This repository is a space to find and share more elaborate examples using the LangChain4j library.
The idea is to allow the community to build on these examples or to use them for demo's.

We welcome all types of more elaborate examples, such as 
- interesting use cases
- elaborate examples with specific providers, frameworks or set-ups
- experimental programs pushing the limits of what is possible with LLM and AI integration.

**For users:**
Please check the README of the example and make sure you use it only as the permissions state

**For contributors:**
If you have an inspiring application that you want to share with the community, you're very welcome to add it here.
Please make sure your project compiles and runs correctly. Please provide a README explaining what your example does, how to run it, and which of the following permissions you grant:
- permission to get inspired and make a similar app
- permission to use the example for demos, while crediting you
- permission to use and extend the application
